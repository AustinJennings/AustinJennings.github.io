		<H1>Lab Work and
			<br>
			Maps I've Made
		</H1>
		<p>
			This is my very first lab assignment.
			<br>
			Unfortunately, there are no other labs
			<br>
			for me to post here yet.
			<br>
			<br>
			I'd say try back later, but this page
			<br>
			is due to retire very soon. Sorry!
			<br>
			<br>
			If it's any consolation, I have embedded
			<br>
			this map of the UWT campus from Google Maps:
			<br>
			<br>

			<br>
			For practice, I have linked this important, yet
			<br>
			entirely unrelated video featuring 
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaqzPMOd_1g">baby sloths</a>
			<br>
			<br>
				<i>(PS - You're wecome.)</i>
			<br>
			<br>
			I also made some radio buttons you can push.
			<br>
			They don't actually do anything, but they are fun!

          <input type = "radio"
                 name = "radSize"
                 id = "rad1"
                 value = "small"
                 checked = "checked" />
          <label for = "rad1">click me</label>
          <input type = "radio"
                 name = "radSize"
                 id = "rad2"
                 value = "medium" />
          <label for = "rad2">or me</label>
          <input type = "radio"
                 name = "radSize"
                 id = "rad3"
                 value = "large" />
          <label for = "rad3">but not me</label>
